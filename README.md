# Raycasting

This is a simple 3D raycasting data pack with the following features:
 * Both instant rays and dynamic rays (in this case a fireball)
 * Fast computations, I had no lag when running this each tick
 * Uses Bhaskara I's sine approximation
 * Resonably acurate, but not perfect
 
 To use, run /function raycast:spawn_instant_ray or /function raycast:spawn_dynamic_ray at the entity from which you want to raycast.
 
 Feel free to use this in your own data pack, either out of the box or modified.
